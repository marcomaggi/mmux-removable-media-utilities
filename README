1. Introduction
---------------

This package  installs scripts  to handle  removable media  devices: USB
pendrives, CD-ROMs.  It depends upon  the Marco's Bash Functions Library
(MBFL).

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.

3. Install
----------

Do this:

    $ cd mmux-removable-media-utilities-1.0a0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

then do it:

    $ ../configure [options] \
       --prefix=/usr
       --sysconfdir=/etc
    $ make
    $ make install

  The  Makefile supports  the  DESTDIR environment  variable to  install
files in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmux-removable-media-utilities

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmux-removable-media-utilities


4. Usage
--------

Read the  documentation.  This  package relies on  "sudo" to  allow file
system mounting and unmounting to the users of the group "plugdev"; such
policy is configured by the file:

   /etc/sudoers.d/mmux-removable-media-utilities.conf

which is installed on the system  by this package: do not blindly accept
this configuration  file!  Take  a good  look at  it make  the necessary
changes for your host.

  Remember that such  sudoers file must be installed on  the system with
octal access permissions 0400; the installation directory must also have
octal access permissions  0700.  Such permissions cannot  be enforced by
the installation infrastructure of this package.

  To enable loading of sudoers configuration modules: we have to include
the following line in the file "/etc/sudoers":

   #includedir /etc/sudoers.d


A. Credits
----------

The  stuff was  written by  Marco Maggi.   If this  package exists  it's
because of the great GNU software tools that he uses all the time.
